Synopsis:
    Two programs, lab1b-server and lab1b-client interact as a
    client and server with the Telnet protocol using sockets.
    The server can also be configured to forward the data stream
    to a shell specified by the --shell option. Data can also be
    compressed from both ends with the --compress option, and the
    client can also log with the --log option.

Client usage:
    ./twoface-client --port=<num> [--log=<filename>] [--compress]

Client options:
    --port=<num>     - specify port number (REQUIRED)
    --log=<filename> - log bytes sent and received to the file
    		       specified by filename
    --compress       - compress data to the server and decompress
    		       data from the server

Server usage:
    ./twoface-server --port=<num> [--shell=<program>] [--compress]

Server options:
    --port=<num>      - specify port number (REQUIRED)
    --shell=<program> - specify shell program to use
    --compress	      - compress data to the client and decompress
    		        data from client

Makefile targets:
    make: creates programs twoface-server and twoface-client
    make twoface-server: creates twoface-server program
    make twoface-client: creates twoface-client program
    make dist: creates the tarball
    make clean: cleans up by removing binary files and tarball
        created by the targets of Makefile
